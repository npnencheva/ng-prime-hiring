# ng-prime-hiring

Angular project

Setup guide:

# Open terminal from the root project folder prime-hiring and run command: npm install
It will install the dependencies to the local node_modules folder.

# From the root project folder run command:  json-server --watch src\db\db.json
I used JSON Server to create demo REST JSON services. The command json-server --watch starts the JSON Server. 
The resources should be accessed on  http://localhost:3000/developers and http://localhost:3000/hiredDevelopers

# In a second terminal run command: ng serve 
Builds and serves the application.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`
